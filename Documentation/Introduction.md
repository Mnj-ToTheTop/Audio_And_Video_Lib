## INTRODUCTION

This project aims to provide high-quality video and audio content without the use of the internet.
This project solves the difficulties of people who watch videos and listen to audio daily. We can play, pause, stop, the audio or video.
If the user does not find their choice of content in the library they can request it. The employee of the library can access the list of requested content and upload them.


## SCOPE
   There are many applications in the market that either provide audio or video content. 
   But by using this project, people can have access to audio and videos at the same time. 
   Besides videos and audio we can also add many types of files to it, like text files, spreadsheets etc, to it in the future. Audio and video files are quite large due to which the database might become a bit slow. 
   This problem can be also solved in the future with some advancements in the application. 
   In the future, various paid subscription packages can be created. 
   This application can also be used as a platform for students to access the video or audio lectures, assignments, test results etc. even in the absence of a network so that network issues do not become an obstacle in the path of education in these times of online schooling.
